# Discrimination in Machine Learning

A hands-on demonstration of how applying machine learning can lead to discrimination.
Without being cautious in selecting data and applying learning algorithms, resulting models can
lead to decisions that are either hostile to certain groups of people or ignore their needs.

This repo contains example datasets and a guided path through running "real" machine learning code
using [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/) through
visual and interactive [Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/).

The datasets and code here are only "real" in sense that they're working software, illustrating
issues in machine learning using technologies that are now part of the mainstream IT industry.
However, they are intentionally trivial examples for demonstration purposes and don't reflect
industry-standard techniques or the more subtle issues that arise in actual projects.
